Used CoinGecko API, ReactJS Framework, and CSS.

# CryptoPriceAware
 ## Track the current prices of the top 100 CryptoCurrencies
 ## Get specified data on any coin and the historical charts for them!
 
### CoinGecko Free API limited to 100 requests -- if errors persist just wait!

### Currently, only chose to show the top 100 coins -- this can increase or decrease at any time! Each page will remain showing 10 coins, the number of pages will vary. 
### Plan on implementing an user database that will allow users to signup and record their purchases and give real-time insights on their Crypto portfolio! 

## To Run
### 1. Copy the GitHub repo
### 2. Insert your own API key -- obtain a free key from coingecko website
### 3. Install all depenendcies and modules.  npm -install 
### 4. To host locally, npm run start -- to host on a service Vercel or Render have great options for hosting React projects!
